# SonarQube Setup and CI-CD Integration Using Docker-Compose
This project included exploring and setting up SonarQube using Docker Compose to manage code quality and automated scanning of codebases during the CI/CD process.

The goal was to implement and configure SonarQube with PostgreSQL in a containerized environment.

=> Set up SonarQube using Docker Compose to manage code quality and continuous integration pipelines.

=> Configured PostgreSQL database to support SonarQube, ensuring secure access and storage of project metrics.

=> Utilized Docker volumes for persistent storage of SonarQube configuration, data, extensions, and logs.

=> Exposed services to appropriate ports, mapping internal and external network interfaces for seamless integration.

=> Configured GitLab repositories to trigger SonarQube analysis as part of the development workflow, ensuring early detection of code issues.

=> Added a dedicated stage in Jenkins pipeline for SonarQube analysis, automating the code quality checks during every build cycle and console output we will get a link which will redirect us to the sonarqube anaylsis for that repository
